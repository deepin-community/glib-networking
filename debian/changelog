  * debian/watch: Watch unstable version too, for experimental.
  * New upstream release 2.43.1, including changes:
    + The GTlsClientConnection "use-ssl3" property now falls back to TLS 1.0
      if SSL 3.0 has been disabled, rather than just failing. Also, we now use
      the gnutls %LATEST_RECORD_VERSION option by default (to allow connecting
      to certain servers that were incorrectly patched for the POODLE attack),
      but also make sure to remove that option in the fallback ("use-ssl3")
      mode (to allow connecting to other servers that are differently broken).
    + tls/gnutls: Miscellaneous warning, debugging, and leak fixes.
  * Bump glib BD to 2.43 (greater than configure.ac; one test requires this
    version).
  * Standards-Version → 3.9.6, no changes required.
